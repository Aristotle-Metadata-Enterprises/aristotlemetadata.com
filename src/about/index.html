                <p>
                    Development of the Aristotle Metadata Registry began in mid-2014 after I, saw a need for organisations
                    to manage their data better, through user-friendly software that could be easily used by everyone.
                </p><p>
                    After working with a few statistical agencies I saw a niche for a world-class metadata registry.
                    Speaking with statistical and data-oriented agencies around the world, I saw that many had built bespoke systems to
                    tackle common problems, all based around the ISO/IEC 11179 metadata registry standard.
                    Each of these organisations had gone about solving and re-solving this problem, but there was a reluctance to share systems due to the perceived risks
                    of government agencies providing commercial software.
                </p><p>
                    Having previously worked on metadata modelling and practical registry design with several Australian government departments,
                    I had began to understanding the technical and user based needs for a metadata registry.
                    Continuing on I began drafting plans for what a user-friendly metadata registry would look like,
                    and began reaching out people who I knew had similar interests.
                </p><p>
                    After a number of consultation sessions and design iterations the first version of the Aristotle Metadata Registry was launched at 
                    <a href="http://iassist2015.pop.umn.edu/program/block2#a3">IASSIST 2015</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I'm proud to say that we are a growing software and services firm with presences in Australia, London and the US,
                    and have brought together a growing community of data users, all using an interconnected, user-friendly metadata system.
