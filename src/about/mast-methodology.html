        <p class="my-2">
            The MAST Manifesto provides a shared belief of why data governance is important and the skills, culture and
            actions required for organisations can achieve good metadata governance.

            <p>
            Metadata is critical to generating value from data. So we must promote the ease of documentation by people creating data.

            <p>
                Good metadata is created by people by analysing business processes and data. People are the heart of data governance.

                The role of modern data governance teams is to support standards adoption, metadata reuse and improved data literacy.

        <p class="my-2">
            The IDEAL Metadata Framework is a pragmatic, step-by-step maturity model to help organisations tackle the right challenges
            at the right time. Each step is designed to improve the data maturity of the organisation, improve data culture and make data more accessible and interpretable.
        </p>
        <p>
            At each step, the IDEAL Framework also specifies key risks and pitfalls that are common in data governance to ensure your organisation
            doesn't lose sight of its end goals and objectives.
