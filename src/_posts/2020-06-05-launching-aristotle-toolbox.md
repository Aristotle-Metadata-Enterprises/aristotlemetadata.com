We at Aristotle Cloud Services Australia believe very strongly in the potential of well organised metadata to ensure that whenever data is needed it can be understood and utilized appropriately. In late February, we made a public commitment as part of the Aristotle Roadmap to improve the experience of our users who needed a high-level picture of the state of metadata within their registry. 

To that end, we’re pleased to announce the release of the Metadata Toolbox and the Metadata Report Builder.

*The Aristotle Toolbox*

The metadata toolbox is a convenient place to access some of our new tools, which are quickly summarized below: 


* **Data Element Component Registration Report** – A specialized and easy to use tool to quickly see which Data Elements have component items that are registered with a different status within your Registration Authority, so you can quickly discover and remedy discrepancies. 

* **Metadata Report Builder** – A powerful tool for administrators to develop deep and novel insights into their own metadata. The report builder allows you, through an intuitive drag and drop user interface, to ask questions like: Which of my workgroup members created the most metadata within the last 12 months? as well as Which items registered in my Registration Authority are missing a Steward Organisation to ensure registered metadata retains currency and accuracy.

Please don’t hesitate to see what kind of questions you can answer about your registry’s metadata with these new tools, and as always, for any questions or concerns we are always available at [hello@aristotlemetadata.com](hello@aristotlemetadata.com).
