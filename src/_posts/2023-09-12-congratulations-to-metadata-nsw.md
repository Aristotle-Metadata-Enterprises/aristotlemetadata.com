Congratulations to the [NSW Department of Customer Services](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nswcustomerservice/?originalSubdomain=au) on the launch of the [Metadata.NSW Metadata Portal](https://metadata.nsw.gov.au/home/)!

A collaborative project between Aristotle Metadata and the NSW Government, [Metadata.NSW](https://metadata.nsw.gov.au/home/) provides a centralised repository for organising, storing and maintaining metadata in a standardised and structured manner, enabling users to easily discover and access relevant information when and where they need it. Metadata.NSW also plays a crucial role in data discoverability, better data management, and analysis within and across NSW Government agencies.

As a catalogue of critical data assets and data elements, Metadata.NSW is making NSW Government data safer by helping agencies to document data so that stakeholders of data know where data is and who is responsible for securing it.

Metadata.NSW presents a full-circle metadata inventory to find and request Government data, ensuring cross-agency collaboration while providing an effective solution for the Government to Academia data pipeline where policy efficacy can be reviewed and documented upon.
