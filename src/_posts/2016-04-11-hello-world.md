After a long time coming, we're ready to go live with our new site!

This is an exciting next step for the Aristotle Metadata Registry that takes us from
proof-of-concept/prototype/start-up land into the world of delivering products.

[Our webpage says it all](/), but to sum up who we are, we are building the 
best, most standards-compliant open-source metadata registry available today
to ensure that everyone from the biggest statistical agency to the smallest non-profit
has access to the best metadata management software to achieve their goals.

Over the coming months we are going to be working with our partners and clients to
build case studies and talk about the road from dream, to implementation, to plucky startup,
and hopefully, to international software infrastructure.
