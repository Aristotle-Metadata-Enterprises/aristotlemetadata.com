We are living in a data-driven and globally interconnected world, and our data strategies need to recognise this to ensure that all users can interact with data in a way that is clear and culturally respectful.

This means that not only should data strategies include a metadata strategy that ensures data in well documented, it also means that data strategies should include a multilingual metadata strategy that helps organisations document data across multiple languages to ensure compliance with relevant cultural and legislative expectations.

Many countries such as Canada and Switzerland have a long culture of bi- or multilingual communication at all levels of government. More recently however, countries such as [Ireland](https://www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/2ea63-20-year-strategy-for-the-irish-language/) and [New Zealand](https://www.education.govt.nz/assets/Documents/Ministry/Strategies-and-policies/Ka-Hikitia/TauMaiTeReoFullStrategyEnglish.pdf) are introducing initiatives to introduce bi-linguality to recognise the cultural importance of indigenous and marginalised communities access to data. Even in a officially "monolingual" countries like Australia, [over a quarter of Australians are now bi- or multilingual](https://profile.id.com.au/australia/speaks-english) with many people indicating that English is a second language.

To support this strategic need to improve cross-cultural access to data, organisations globally need tools that enable them to consistently document their metadata across multiple languages in a consistent way that improves information discovery.

Thats why this Monday 21 February 2022 on [United Nations International Day of the Mother Tongue](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/02/1085312), we are proud announce the upcoming launch of a new multi-lingual library for the Aristotle Metadata Registry and the Tablion Data Portal that allows organisations to quickly and accurately document their data in a culturally respectful multilingual manner.

From next week, administrators of all Aristotle Metadata product can start defining the languages used across their registries to ensure that users accurately know the 

This new multilingual Aristotle Metadata Registry will also allow administrators to define multiple languages set across the registry to help users document their data.

    <small>Users will now be able to select a language across Aristotle to see metadata in their preferred language.</small>

Beyond just capturing synonyms, every metadata item can now store name and definitions, codes and classifications all across multiple languages so that users know the equivalence between terms across languages for all business knowledge.

This new multilingual version of the Aristotle Metadata Registry will also provide safe, informative fallbacks so that when content isn’t available, they are shown information in a fallback language defined by the registry.

We’re thankful for all of the feedback we received from our global beta-testers across Europe, New Zealand & Canada who help refine the amazing new addition to the Aristotle Metadata Registry - and look forward to see our users make their data make sense for even more people around the world.

Stay tuned for more news about how we engineered this amazing new update using [`django-garnett` the new multilingual open-source library we've built for the Django Web Framework](https://github.com/Aristotle-Metadata-Enterprises/django-garnett).
