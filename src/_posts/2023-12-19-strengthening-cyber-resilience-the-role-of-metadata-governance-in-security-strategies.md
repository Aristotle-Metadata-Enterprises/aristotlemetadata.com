With the risk of cyber threats continuing to increase, maintaining a secure environment demands constant attention and more than just reactive measures. Ensuring safety from cyber threats requires a proactive and comprehensive approach, and a key component of a successful cyber strategy is effective governance of metadata and data. These governing practices not only ensure streamlined operations but also improve cyber resilience in various ways.

**Metadata Standards and Consistency:**
Establishing standardised metadata practices guarantees consistency in data description. Consistent metadata vastly improves the accuracy and efficiency of security measures, notably in threat detection and incident response. 

**Data Classification and Categorisation:**
Effective data governance begins with the clear identification and categorisation of data based on its sensitivity and significance. This classification/categorisation enables the deployment of tailored security measures like encryption and access controls, bolstering protection where it's most necessary. 

**Access Control Policies:**
IT System governance frameworks establish regulated access control policies that identify who can access specific data and under what conditions. Such measures act as a deterrent against unauthorised access and insider threats, enhancing overall cyber security. 

**Privacy Compliance:**
Effective IT and cyber governance ensure compliance with privacy regulations by defining protocols for handling sensitive information. This not only mitigates legal risks but also safeguards the organisation's reputation against data breaches and impacts from non-compliance. 

**Data Retention and Disposal Policies:**
Guidelines for data retention and secure disposal are integral components of IT and cyber governance frameworks. These policies limit data exposure and unauthorised access by enforcing strict guidelines on data retention periods. 

**Data Ownership and Accountability:**
Clarity on data ownership and accountability structures is pivotal in data and cyber security governance. Assigning responsibility for the security and integrity of specific datasets fosters a culture of diligence and responsibility among teams. Metadata registries are an excellent mechanism for organisations to effectively govern data ownership and manage accountability.  

**Risk Management:**
Incorporating risk management practices aids in identifying and prioritising data-related risks. This facilitates resource allocation to cease critical threats to data security. 

**Auditability and Monitoring:**
Mandated regular audits and monitoring of data access and usage ensures adherence to security policies and swift identification of suspicious activities. 

**Training and Awareness:**
Educational programs embedded within governance initiatives cultivate a culture of data security awareness among employees. This solidifies an organisation's overall security posture by instilling a sense of responsibility and vigilance among users. 

**Data Integrity and Quality:**
Effective IT and cyber governance require good data integrity and quality, ensuring reliability and accuracy for informed decision-making and robust security analysis. 

**Incident Response Planning:**
Organisations must undertake meticulous planning for incident responses, so to facilitate swift and coordinated actions in the event of a cyber incident/data breach, thereby minimising potential damage. 

**Continuous Improvement:**
An inherent part of good governance is a commitment to continuously improve data and metadata management practices. This adaptability is essential in countering evolving cyber threats and technological advancements. 

In essence, effective IT and cyber practices that incorporate the above enable a resilient cyber security strategy. By actioning these areas, the defences against cyber threats and attacks are strengthened and provide a robust organisation-wide foundation for data protection and integrity.
