This week marked a massive milestone for Aristotle Metadata, as our platform, Metadata.NSW, and work with the NSW Government won the ACT AIIA Award in the Technology Platform Category, with Aristotle’s Lynton and Peter in accepting the award.

Aristotle’s CEO, Sam Spencer, said, “This award is recognition of the hard work of our whole team over the past several years to build amazing outcomes for Australia. Being recognised for our part working alongside the NSW Government to close the gap for Australia’s most vulnerable citizens shows how metadata makes a real, positive impact on all our lives.”

We thank AIIA for this award, and congratulations to all other nominees and award winners.
