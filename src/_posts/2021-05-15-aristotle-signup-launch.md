# Free trials of the Aristotle Metadata Registry is now available as a fully self-managed Software-as-a-Service

On April 29th, at the Hyatt Canberra Aristotle Cloud Services launched a new self-managed version of the Aristotle Metadata Registry.

At our recent executive breakfast Aristotle Cloud Services CEO [Samuel Spencer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/legostormtroopr/) and former Australian Statistician [David Kalisch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-kalisch-faicd-8a31211a4/) spoke to over 50 executive guests about the value of data and metadata strategy for the public sector.

During this event, Aristotle Cloud Services also launched a new self sign up portal for user looking to trial metadata registries in a risk-free way: [https://aristotlemetadata.com/signup](https://aristotlemetadata.com/signup).

Of the new product launch, Samuel Spencer said "our new self-sign up process is powered by the same enterprise-grade infrastructure that supports all of our clients. By using the same AWS technology that provides self-healing, backed up services for our clients - we were able to build a new self-sign up portal that give access to Aristotle Metadata technologies faster."

During the event, Mr Spencer was also quoted saying "I believe that Aristotle Metadata will be the next big technology success story for Australia, and we are proud to have launched it here in Canberra".

Similar to other self-sign up software-as-a-service products, like Jira, Confluence and Canva, the self-managed version of the Aristotle Metadata Registry provides access to enterprise metadata solutions direct to end users in the public and private sectors. "By building a new self-managed version of our software, users can quickly build business value from their data without having to engage in lengthy procurement processes", said Aristotle Cloud Services Chief Operating Officer Lauren Eickhorst.

The Aristotle Metadata Registry is now available for the management, governance and publication of data dictionaries, data asset registries, performance frameworks and can be tried for free for up to 6 months now at: **[https://aristotlemetadata.com/signup](https://aristotlemetadata.com/signup)**.
