### Aristotle Metadata Registry v4.7.1 is now available to all clients.

This is a major feature release that includes improvements to reviews and issues site wide to make it easier for users to collaborate when developing metadata.

This is the new Issues page which will be available from the Dashboard side panel. From here, you have access to all the issues you have permission to view.

This is the new and improved Review Requests page which will still be available from the Dashboard side panel. We are moving the Review List for Registrars into here as well, having all reviews available in one place and making them easier to view.
