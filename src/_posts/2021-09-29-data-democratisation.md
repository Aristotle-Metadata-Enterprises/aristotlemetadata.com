Put simply, data democratization is when ["everybody has access to data and there are no gatekeepers that create a bottleneck at the gateway to the data"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/07/24/what-is-data-democratization-a-super-simple-explanation-and-the-key-pros-and-cons/). Data democratization doesn't mean that all data is open by default, but it does mean that everyone across the business has clear visibility about what data exists, who is responsible for it and how it can be accessed. This can be from simple data asset listings, data dictionaries or - ideally - a metadata registry that provides permission-based visiblity of data.

Improving the access and visibility of data reduces friction across the organisation, by giving everyone a single place to search for data, improves understanding of what data is available, and increases efficiency by connecting data custodians and data users in a secure way.

[Data democratization has been recognised as a key strategy trend by Gartner research](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-10-strategic-technology-trends-for-2020), and organisations needs to be prepare to meet the new strategic challenge.
