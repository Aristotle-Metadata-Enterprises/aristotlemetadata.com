Aristotle Metadata is calling on industry experts, data professionals and data users to take part in a global test run of the MAST Certification process. Scheduled across varying dates in Canberra, Australia; Wellington, New Zealand; Nova Scotia, Canada; and Sydney, Australia, participants will receive an exclusive ‘first look’ at the MAST Certification course, along with being able to provide feedback and insights into the course structure, assisting Aristotle in its endeavours to seek new ways to close the framework gap for metadata management and data governance.

MAST provides a shared belief of why data governance is important and the skills, culture and actions required for organisations to achieve good metadata governance. By certifying this process and creating a unified standard, Aristotle is able to ensure greater data governance and accuracy across organisations, regardless of how the metadata is managed. 
 
Expressions of interest for participation are now open. Don't miss out on this exclusive opportunity to have your experience recognised and contribute to industry advancement.

What to Expect:

* Opportunity to shape industry standards and become MAST certified.
* Be part of a global test run, providing valuable feedback for final refinement.
* Make your mark on metadata and data governance practices.
* Engage with global perspectives from experts in NZ and Canada.
* Morning tea and light refreshments.

Who is this for:
* Data industry professionals of all levels.
* Data and metadata analysts.
* Users of metadata and data registries, from data stewards to academics.
