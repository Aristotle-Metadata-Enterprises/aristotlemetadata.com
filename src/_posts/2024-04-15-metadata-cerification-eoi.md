Aristotle Metadata is calling on industry experts, data professionals and data users to take part in a global test run of the MAST Certification process. Scheduled across varying dates in Canberra, Australia; Wellington, New Zealand; Nova Scotia, Canada; and Sydney, Australia, participants will receive an exclusive ‘first look’ at the MAST Certification course, along with being able to provide feedback and insights into the course structure and future directions of the MAST Methodology, assisting Aristotle Metadata in its endeavours to seek new ways to close the cultural and framework gap for metadata management and data governance.

MAST provides a shared belief of why data governance is important and the skills, culture and actions required for organisations to achieve good metadata governance. By certifying this process and creating a unified standard, Aristotle Metadata is able to ensure greater data governance and accuracy across organisations, regardless of how the metadata is managed.
