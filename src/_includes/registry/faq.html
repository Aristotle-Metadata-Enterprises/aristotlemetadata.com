                                Each year, in collaboration with our clients we coordinate the development of the Aristotle Metadata Roadmap that lays out 
                                features and improvements users can expect to the platform each year.
                                This process helps to gather and prioritise feedback, and ensures that the Aristotle Metadata Registry remains a leading, user-friendly metadata registry.
                            </p><p>
                                All users have the ability to provide feedback through our community, or through their registry administrators.
                                Once feedback has been gathered, we develop and circulate draft roadmaps to our clients, and invite clients to nominate representatives to
                                participate and endorse our annual product roadmap.

                                <strong>Yes</strong> - Each plan includes a number of user licences, and to limit disruption we won't prevent your users from signing up.
                                If we detect that you are getting close to exceeding
                                your included licences, we will contact you to dicuss way to help manage your registry.
                                Options can include up-front purchasing of additional user licences, monthly invoicing or adding a hard limit.

                                Only active users or teams count against your limits so you can always deactivate users who no longer use the system,
                                or archive teams to increase capacity.

                                <strong>A Stewardship Organisation</strong> is a group responsible for the creation and governance data and metadata.
                                It could be a whole company, a business unit, committee or or data council. Each Stewardship Organisation can define
                                its own governance roles and teams to delegate responsibility and help with the development of

                                In the Aristotle Metadata Registry, we use Stewardship Organisations to allow our clients capture of the related governance
                                groups within their organisation. This allows our users to capture multiple separate business silos within a single registry,
                                or even build <em>multi-tenancy</em> metadata solutions that can be shared among related organisations.
