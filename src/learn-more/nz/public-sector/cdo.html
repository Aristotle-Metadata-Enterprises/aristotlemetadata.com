    Changing expectations within the public around data access & transparency
    require strategies that deliver faster access to data without sacrificing security.
    Go beyond cataloguing to implement a holistic data platform to reduce the risk of
    disclosure of sensitive data and increase ongoing value generation from data.

    Using Aristotle Metadata you can get a faster return-on-investment (ROI) by
    leveraging interest in data sharing to improve data quality by:

    * Engaging users & business users across the entire organisation
    * Improving the efficiency of data governance
    * Increasing oversight of data using out-of-the-box CDO dashboards

            We helped a government department build a data profiler to index data assets in a central location to search across data lakes.
            This was supported by a Tablion Data Portal that delivered an end-to-end system which **reduced time to respond to data requests by 50%**.

            This ensures that all users are able to understand data collected for them and about them in the terms and langage most culturally appropriate -
            a key requirement in achieving <a href="https://www.temanararaunga.maori.nz/">Māori Data Sovereignty</a>.
        achievements:

            **Over 60% of all business terms were recorded in at least 2 languages**, improving compliance with government policy, improving cultural sensitivity of data
            and increasing the engagement and use of data by multiculutural researchers.
