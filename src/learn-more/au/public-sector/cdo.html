    Changing expectations within the public around data access & transparency
    require strategies that deliver faster access to data without sacrificing security.
    Go beyond cataloguing to implement a holistic data platform to reduce the risk of

    leveraging interest in data sharing to improve data quality by:

    * Engaging users & business users across the entire organisation
    * Improving the efficiency of data governance
    * Increasing oversight of data using out-of-the-box CDO dashboards
