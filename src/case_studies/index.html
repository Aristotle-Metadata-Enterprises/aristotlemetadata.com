<p>
    We've been engaging with government agencies at all levels in a number of countries demonstrating how metadata can help improve 
    data accuracy and timeliness as well as formalise governance arrangements between agencies.

    By providing our clients with authoring tools to create metadata early in the data collection process we're helping reduce
    work throughout the <a href="http://www.iassistdata.org/blog/conceptualizing-digital-life-cycle">data collection lifecycle</a>.
    Our client is able to create definitions of data earlier, providing the information needed to verify data during collection and cleansing,
    as well as giving them the information they need to ensure they are collecting the required information in the right ways.
</p><p>
    By using an Aristotle Metadata Registry our client has made this metadata available through a web
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface"><i>Application Program Interface</i></a>
    that helps their systems and people communicate effectively and make data management tasks more robust and repeatable.

<p>
    Using an Aristotle Metadata Registry is also helping our clients enforce governance across jurisdictions so that data collections are consistent by 
    allowing for different authorities to endorse metadata suitability as it is created.
</p><p>
    By publishing data dictionaries from Aristotle, our client has improved their ability to
    verify the correctness and completeness of administrative data that is shared between agencies.
    If inconsistancies are found they can be compared to agreed upon standards within the registry
    and coherence can be enforced through these published governance arrangements.
</p>
<p>
    Using shared access agrements, with an Aristotle Metadata Registry, our clients are able to publish 
    clear data rules that enforce consistency and formalise data governance agreements across a broad range of stakeholders.

    We've been working with academic, science and data organisations to explore how to help bring structure and knowledge to 
    research data to make archival and discovery easier.

<p>
    Our work with an academic social research centre has helped archivists improve records of studies.
    By providing tools that streamline metadata creation they are encouraging researchers to document
    their research and showing how this makes data easier to discover.
    These efforts have already given researchers the ability to answer questions such as,
    <i>"What work has been done on hospitalisation and recovery time?"</i> or
    <i>"What data exists that covers academic success and childhood health?"</i>.
    By giving researchers and archivists the tools to record the structure of data we're making sure 
    future questions can be answered quickly to guide research in the right directions.
</p>
<p>
    Data archives have explored the advantages of metadata but many still struggle with the problem of how to encourage
    time starved researchers to document work. To support this we're studying how to help both, researching techniques for 
    <em>automated semantic metadata authoring</em> as a way to describe the structure of data collections by comparing
    sample data against existing metadata records. This saves time for researchers when registering data and ensures high quality
    data for archival purposes.

    One of the driving goals of the Aristotle Metadata Registry is to give all agencies the ability to 
    produce positive change. We've been working with non-profit and charity organisations to build 
    registries that help track change and improve data management practises.
</p>
<p>
    One of our first clients was working to help metadata modelling for social welfare to improve
    the measurement and evaluation of programs for at-risk individuals in unstable social circumstances.
    This work helped improve the definition of indicator metrics so that the different agencies
    in this working group could communicate their data in agreed formats that reduced
    discrepancies in data collection, improved understanding and reduced costs.
</p>
<p>
    By commiting to open-source and standards-based
    solutions we're providing cost effective information management solutions
    that integrate with existing systems without the risk of vendor lock-in.
