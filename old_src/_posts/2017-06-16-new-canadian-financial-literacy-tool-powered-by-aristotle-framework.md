We are pleased to announce that the Canadian Bankers Association is using an open-sourced version of the Aristotle Metadata Registry.

> Prosper Canada, a national charity dedicated to expanding economic opportunity for Canadians living in poverty, the Canadian Bankers Association (CBA) and the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC) have launched an online tool to help organizations evaluate their financial literacy programs.

The tool, which is known as The Financial Literacy Outcome Evaluation Tool can be accessed here: [http://outcomeeval.org/](http://outcomeeval.org/)

On their website, the [Canadian Bankers Association](http://cba.ca/financial-literacy-evaluation-tool) describes the tool as “a free and tailored tool that benefits private, public and community-based organisations seeking to improve their financial literacy programming.” [Market Wired](http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/launch-of-new-online-tool-to-help-evaluate-financial-literacy-programs-in-canada-2192491.htm) reports that, “this tool will make evaluation of financial literacy initiatives easier, more rigorous, and more likely, focus funders and delivery organizations on shared, evidence-based outcomes and indicators, and leverage existing research evidence to strengthen current and future programs.”

Sam Spencer, the lead developer of the Aristotle Metadata Registry, was excited to provide technical assistance to the team building this tool and is happy to see the results of their efforts.

The Aristotle Metadata Registry is proud to have such important organisations using the Registry’s framework to evaluate financial literacy programs across Canada.
