Aristotle Cloud Metadata Registry has been selected by Potential<sup>(x)</sup> as their metadata registry tool. Aristotle helps organisations track the performance of their policies through a tool that is a single source of truth for both the meanings and governance of data.

Potential<sup>(x)</sup>  is one of the premier health analytics and advisory firms in Australia and New Zealand. Potential<sup>(x)</sup>  provides deep benchmarking analysis, reports and advisory support on performance to the health & human service sectors internationally, working with hospitals and disability organisations to track and measure performance improvement and change.

“This is an exciting time for Aristotle Cloud Services and a great opportunity for the private health sector to capitalise on the return on investment a shared metadata registry brings. We want to do everything we can to ensure Potential<sup>(x)</sup> has clear high-quality information management.” Sam Spencer CEO of Aristotle Cloud Services said, “A metadata registry like Aristotle does just that.”

Duane Attree, Managing Director, Potential<sup>(x)</sup> outlined the reasons for this engagement: “Our business relies on quality data to ensure we produce high quality, robust analytics, and insights that make a difference to the care and service our clients deliver. Having a partner and platform like Aristotle Metadata Registry ensures we can build new products and services with confidence that our approach to data management is best in class”

Aristotle is looking forward to collaborating with our Potential<sup>(x)</sup>  colleagues by helping with training and learning more about the metadata needs of the health sector. This opportunity expands our work with clients in the health and social welfare spaces to make sure that they can manage and improve the lives of the people they work with.
