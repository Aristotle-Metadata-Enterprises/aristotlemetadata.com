On March 6th, we will be holding the 2021 Aristotle Metadata Roadmap to discuss and finalise the features and enhancements we will be adding to the Aristotle Metadata Registry, as well as discuss new training and community work we will be doing throughout 2021.

This week emails will be sent to all client representatives of the Aristotle Metadata Registry inviting them to the upcoming meeting advising them of the draft roadmap and details on how to provide feedback.

To provide a COVID-safe environment for gathering feedback, this years committee meeting will be a virtual event chaired by [Aristotle Metadata board member Lynton Norris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lynton-norris-fcpa-gaicd-a48a1a96/).

Prior to the committee meeting, we will also be holding feedback sessions in 3 timezones to gather feedback from users globally to ensure that all Aristotle metadata users have the opportunity to participate and provide input.

If you'd like to attend an upcoming Aristotle Metadata Roadmap feedback session, please RSVP to one of the sessions below:

* [Australia / Asia-Pacific: 25 February 2020, 4pm GMT+11]()
* [Europe / Africa: 25 February 2020, 9am GMT+0]()
