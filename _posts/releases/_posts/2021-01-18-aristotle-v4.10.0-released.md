### Aristotle Metadata Registry v4.10.0 is now available to all clients.

This is a major feature release that includes new tools for registry administrators to set new content management policies to control the editing and deletion of metadata.

Previously, users could only delete metadata that was in their Sandbox. But now, registry administrator can set permissions that allow Workgroup managers and Stewardship Organisation administrators to delete metadata based on their own governance arrangements.

Administrators can also now also control the editing permissions of metadata registered contenwithin the registry.
