On February 18th 2020, Aristotle Cloud Services clients and key invited technical experts met at the Aristotle Canberra offices to participate in the 2020 Aristotle Roadmap Committee meeting.

The goal of this meeting was for our clients to work with us to prioritise feature development for the upcoming year. By openly working with our clients we provide clients with more influence over the direction of the product and provide accountability.

It also give us the opportunity to directly communicate back to clients and talk through our feature development process so users can understand why we prioritise certain features.

While client-to-vendor interactions are valuable, focus on **client-to-client communication** helps users share knowledge directly with each other. Clients and users of software will always have a different approach and understanding of the tool than the people who build it. By encouraging this direct communication, clients are able to share these direct, genuine and unique experiences with each other, as well as with us at Aristotle.

During the meeting members of the Roadmap Committee were encouraged to provide feedback on proposed features. This feedback looked at implementation and timing of feature releases based on each users needs. Feedback was then workshopped among particpants, with each member offering their own unique perspective. The result of this collaborative process was an improved understanding of how proposed features would benefit different users, leading to an improved 2020 Feature Development Roadmap that will benefit all users of the Aristotle Metadata Registry.

The end result of the meeting is the now fully endorsed [2020 Aristotle Development Roadmap](/aristotle/images/blog/2020 Aristotle Roadmap - Final endorsed.pdf), available for review now.
