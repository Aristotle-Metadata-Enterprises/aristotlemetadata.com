On October 14th, the [International Organization for Standardization](https://www.iso.org/)
celebrates [World Standards Day](https://www.iso.org/world-standards-day.html),
to recognise the importants of standards to the global economy.

For our clients, the ability to create, maintain and publish data standards is of 
mission critical importance. Our users are responsible for tracking performance of 
national health systems, gathering data to track enonomic stability or undergoing 
research into social outcomes. These activities rely on accurate data that follows 
quality guidelines, to ensure the that information in readily understood by all 
users of the data.

Aristotle supports our clients by building Metadata Registries that can record 
standard data definitions across each of these domains to make sure that data 
is clearly understood. The registries make it easier for our clients to build 
and publish their own data standards, and our standard APIs enable them to build 
tools that make sure data follows these standards.

This is why Aristotle is committed to the development of open standards and open 
APIs. Our core product, the Aristotle Metadata Registry, adheres to key 
[ISO standards for metadata](http://metadata-standards.org/), and our extensions 
follow standards set out by the World Wide Web Consortium and the 
[United Nations statistical bodies](https://statswiki.unece.org/display/gsim/Generic+Statistical+Information+Model).
We've implemented this by using and producing open-source software, and by
following open technical standards like 
[OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/).

Every day we're using standards to build value for clients, so that's why 
today Aristotle celebrates World Standards Day!
