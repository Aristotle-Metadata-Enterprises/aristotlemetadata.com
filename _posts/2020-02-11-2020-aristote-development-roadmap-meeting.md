On February 18th 2020, Aristotle Cloud Services clients and key invited technical experts met at the Aristotle Canberra offices to particpate in the 2020 Aristotle Roadmap Committee meeting.

The goal of this meeting was for our clients to work with us to priorise feature development for the upcoming year. By openly working with our clients we provide clients with more influence over the direction of the product and provide accountability.

It also give us the opportunity to directly communicate back to clients and talk through our feature development process so users can understand my we prioritise certain features.

While client-to-vendor interatcions are valuable, focus on **client-to-client communication** helps users share knowledge directly with each other. Clients and users of software will always have a different approach and understanding of the tool than the people who build it. By encouraging this direct communication, clients able to share these direct, genuine unique experiences with each other and with us at Aristotle.

The value of these interatctions on the day, was that on the data users were able to brainstorm on each others ideas from these unqiue perspective and provide feedback that improves Aristotle for all users.

The end results of the meeting is the now fully endorsed [2020 Aristotle Development Roadmap](/aristotle/images/blog/2020 Aristotle Roadmap - Final endorsed.pdf) now available for review.
