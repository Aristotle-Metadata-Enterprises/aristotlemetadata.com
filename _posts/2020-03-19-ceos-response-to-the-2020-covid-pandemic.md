Dear Clients and Associates,

I want to let you know that Aristotle Cloud Services Australia has implemented its Business Continuity Plan so we can continue to provide services that meet our high standards, as we all adjust to changes necessary to limit the impacts of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic.
 
Effectively immediately, all Aristotle staff are now working remotely to contribute to the ongoing attempts to “flatten the curve” and reduce the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus.
 
As a small business providing cloud services to a diverse range of clients, we have not had to change our hosting, deployment or support strategies – and are able to continue monitoring services and support email boxes to ensure we continue to serve our clients. With a team of staff across two continents and a global client base, we are experienced with remote working and look forward to working closely but remotely with all of our clients for the near future.
 
Where feasible we will be transitioning meetings to be online or via telephone to ensure the safety of our clients and the community. However, where this is not possible we will be taking meetings on-site with clients, in consideration of social distancing measures recommended by the Australian Government.

**What we are doing to support you?**

In the 2020 Aristotle Product Roadmap, we announced we would be promoting and supporting an online community of metadata experts to improve information sharing of metadata experiences across sectors.
As Australia adjusts to new remote working and work from home arrangements, our commitment to our community remains a high priority, now more than ever. In the coming weeks we will be emailing those who have already registered interests in joining this community. I also encourage you to make your colleagues aware of this online metadata community and sharing details about this with your staff https://mailchi.mp/36adf0cc42dc/aristotle-community-preview

Due to the current environment we are seeing news reports showing a massively increased global trend in requests for health data.
We will continue to work closely with our partners across the public sector to ensure that key metadata associated with health data collected and shared about the current pandemic remains available. We have altered our current scaling strategies to ensure key metadata systems remain available, regardless of the volume of web traffic, to reduce the risk of misinformation.
 
In the coming weeks we will also be producing and sharing key metadata sources related to the COVID-19 pandemic to assist researchers find and interpret key metadata about global data collections.
 
If you have any questions about how we are managing your Aristotle Metadata Registry, contact your account manager or email our support team at support@aristotlemetadata.com.

We wish all of our clients the best during these challenging times ahead.
Thanks for your support,

Samuel Spencer – Chief Executive Officer
