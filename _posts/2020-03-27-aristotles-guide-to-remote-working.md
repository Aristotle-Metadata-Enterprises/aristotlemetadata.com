title: Aristotle's guide to remote working
author: larrn

The digital economy has created new ways for people to work and engage with staff, however these
aren’t without their challenges. Many traditional metadata tools are not built to support remote
working, so it is important to choose tools and processes that enable staff to perform their work
wherever they may be.

We’ve selected our top 5 tips for remote working we use at Aristotle Cloud Services Australia and
look at how the Aristotle Metadata Registry helps you implement these tips in your business.

We've also produced a [complete guide to remote remote working using Aristotle](/aristotle/images/blog/2020 Remote working at Aristotle.pdf), that includes key advice on how to implement all of these tips within the Aristotle Metadata Registry.

1. Communicate clearly and often

	Most communication in the workplace is non-verbal such as tone and posture. We lose most
	of these cues when we switch to email and instant messaging. Communicating clearly and
	respectfully is key to ensuring that everyone is working in sync. 

2. Seek and receive constructive feedback

	Because of how our communication styles change online, it’s important to adjust how we
	receive feedback from co-workers. Invite your colleagues to provide feedback on work to
	ensure everyone’s opinions are heard. 

3. Accommodate asynchronicity

	When working remotely it’s hard to know when co-workers are available. Just like in the office,
	when working from home people may be focused on a challenging task or taking a short break
	from their desk to clear their thoughts. Just because someone isn’t online doesn’t mean they
	aren’t working.

	Instant messaging tools like Slack or Teams let you set statuses, so your team knows when
	you’re available. While you’re away, they notify you of what you’ve missed so you can respond
	to your co-workers. 

4. Document decisions near your data

	Remote working can make it harder to track how decisions have been made – this is especially
	sensitive when documents or webpages are made public. Tools like Github and Wordpress
	include review and workflow tools so that draft content can be reviewed before it goes live.
	Recording decisions in the same place as your content lets others track work as it progresses. 

5. Keep people informed of changes

	When remotely collaborating on documents or webpages make sure you let colleagues know
	of what you are changing and why. Online tools like Aristotle or Office365 make it easy to
	work together, but if you are sharing Word documents via email, use track changes and
	comments to help others know what’s been changed.

6. Have fun and keep it light

	One of the biggest shifts to working remotely is the lack of informal communication. Many
	guides to professional communication encourage dry writing styles which works for emails
	but may not be appropriate when instant messaging. When remote working it’s important to
	balance professional communication while retaining human connections.

	Using humour and emojis, sharing personal stories and bringing water-cooler chats to online
	messaging tools keep us connected when we can’t be physically present. Online we have
	more control to filtering what we see and when we respond, so over-communication is key!
