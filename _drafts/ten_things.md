title: Ten things to know about the Aristotle Metadata Registry

1. **A purpose-built metadata registry** &mdash; 
    Aristotle-MDR is built from the ground up to be a world-class standards conformant metadata registry.
    It isn’t a web content management system, although it has one, it isn’t a data warehouse,
    although it enables them, and it isn’t a “something else”!
    This strict focus means that Aristotle is everything a metadata registry needs to be to enable quality
    data and metadata management.

1. **Standards compliant** &mdash; 
    Aristotle-MDR is a metadata registry that conforms to the ISO 11179 specifications like no other. Conforming to international specifications isn’t an optional ads-on, it’s a core part of the Aristotle mission statement. Which means everyone using Aristotle is speaking the same language.

1. **Extensible** &mdash; 
    Standards compliant doesn’t mean locked down. ISO 11179 supports extensible metamodels and the extension framework of Aristotle puts those principles into practice. There are already a number of extensions to support common use cases for metadata management and with the right team new modules can be built, tested and shared.

1. **Community-driven and open-source** &mdash; 
    Modern metadata systems don’t exist in isolation. Aristotle is already building a community of metadata experts that support the vision of tools that enable open metadata communities to thrive.

1. **Enterprise ready and scalable** &mdash; 
    Aristotle is built using the same framework that powers NASA, National Geographic and Instagram and uses enterprise-level search engines that powerfully support users finding what they need.

1. **Modern and user-centred** &mdash; 
    Aristotle has a responsive user interface that feels at home in the modern internet ecosystem, and supports a common look-and-feel across browsers, mobile, tablet and more, all while keeping a consistent user friendly and attractive interface.

1. **Future-proof** &mdash; 
    Not only is Aristotle ready to meet the metadata needs of clients today. With a solid, growing community, a standards based approach and an extensible framework, Aristotle can grow to meet the evolving needs of data agencies and other actors across jurisdictions, sectors, and nations as user requirements change over time.
 
1. **Intelligent and predictive** &mdash; 
    Behind the scenes Aristotle has an enterprise search engine that mines content making search smarter and more reactive to user needs. This then powers a rich authoring system that anticipates user requirements and makes reusing and harmonising metadata easier and quicker.

1. **Secure and tested** &mdash; 
    User authentication conforms to NIST recommendation and Aristotle has a thorough, public test suite that checks every line of code, every time there is a change. This means that as the platform grows we can be sure that the system stays secure, and information is safe and bug-free.

1. **Ready to go now!** &mdash; 
    Aristotle isn’t a development plan, it’s a product that can be used today. The project will create a range of further functional extensions and user experience enhancements – but the foundations are live, in place, and impressing metadata experts.
